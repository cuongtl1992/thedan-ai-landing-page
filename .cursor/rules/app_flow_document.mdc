# App Flow Document for TheDan AI Landing Page

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a brand-new user visits TheDan AI landing page, they will usually discover it through search results, a shared link on social media, or direct navigation thanks to well-placed SEO optimizations and clear meta tag implementations. The landing page immediately presents a simple and modern interface that introduces the platform in clear, concise language. The header features a straightforward navigation bar with links to various sections like Features, Pricing, About Us, and Contact, as well as a language toggle allowing users to switch between Vietnamese and English. Additionally, the navigation bar includes a notable Sign In / Sign Up link which directs users to the dedicated authentication app at https://app.thedan.biz. This external link is clearly labeled and ensures that those interested in creating an account or accessing their existing account know exactly where to click. On the authentication service, users are able to complete the usual steps for signing in, signing out, and recovering lost passwords. Although these actions take place on a different platform, the landing page clearly communicates the pathway to begin the onboarding process.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After arriving at the landing page, users encounter a visually engaging and easy-to-navigate home page that adheres to a modern aesthetic. The page is built with a clean design and a carefully chosen color scheme that supports both light and dark modes with a smooth transition animation. The header clearly displays the navigation bar with links to the main sections along with the dark/light mode toggle and language switcher. The hero section immediately follows the header and features a bold and attractive backdrop, accompanied by a catchy tagline that captures the essence of TheDan AI. A prominent call-to-action button is featured in the hero area, inviting visitors to sign up by redirecting them to the dedicated registration page. Following the hero section, other major sections such as the Overview, Pricing, and Contact appear as part of a single-page layout with smooth scrolling transitions, ensuring that every part of the page is easily accessible without reloading the page.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
As users scroll down from the hero section, they are introduced to an overview section that explains the core functionalities and value of TheDan AI. Here the content is presented in a straightforward and highly legible format, with smooth scrolling ensuring seamless navigation between sections. The navigation bar remains visible at the top throughout the browsing experience, allowing users to quickly jump to sections such as Features, Pricing, About Us, and Contact by clicking on the respective links. When users click on the call-to-action button in the hero section, they are seamlessly taken to the sign-up flow hosted on the external authentication service. Similarly, any navigation action, such as clicking on the Pricing link, slides the user smoothly to the dedicated pricing section. This section explicitly details the three pricing options: Personal, Pro, and Business with clear information regarding the number of agents and MCP provided for each. As users continue to scroll, they reach a contact section that features a lead capture or inquiry form. In this interactive flow, users input their name, email address, and a message. Before the form can be submitted, simple validation checks ensure that all required fields are completed correctly, especially verifying that the email is well formatted. On successful submission, the user is presented with a confirmation message that their inquiry has been received. Throughout the entire journey, the transition between sections is designed to be smooth and connected, providing a consistent and frictionless browsing experience.

## Settings and Account Management
While the landing page itself is a static presentation used primarily for informational purposes, it does include a few interactive settings that allow users to personalize their viewing experience. In the navigation bar, users can switch the website’s language between Vietnamese and English, ensuring that the content is accessible to a wider audience. There is also a dark/light mode toggle that enables users to change the visual theme of the page with a subtle fade animation lasting between 200 and 300 milliseconds. These settings are immediately applied across the entire site, with the color variables for backgrounds, texts, borders, and accents adjusting in real time to maintain a consistent aesthetic. Although there is no direct account management on this landing page, these personalization options serve as an introduction to the overall design philosophy of TheDan AI, emphasizing user control and a clean user experience. Once users have made their changes, they can continue exploring the landing page without any interruption in the overall flow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
In cases where users might enter invalid data in the contact form or experience connectivity issues while submitting their inquiry, clear error states have been designed to maintain the smooth user journey. If a required field is left empty or an email address is incorrectly formatted, the page displays an error message near the form field prompting the user to correct the information. This validation is straightforward and user-friendly, ensuring that the user can quickly rectify any mistakes and continue. In the event of network issues during form submission, an error message may appear to inform the user that the submission could not be completed at that moment and offer a retry option. Additionally, any attempt to access a section of the landing page that might not exist will route the user to a fallback error page, such as a 404, which still maintains the same modern design language and provides clear instructions on how to navigate back to the homepage. These error states and alternate paths are structured in a way that allows users to quickly return to the main content without feeling lost or frustrated.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the moment a visitor first discovers TheDan AI landing page until they decide to take further action, the entire journey is designed to be simple, modern, and fully connected. New users learn about the platform through a clean and visually appealing hero section, explore the specific features, review clearly displayed pricing details, and are encouraged to make a commitment by clicking the call-to-action that redirects them to the dedicated sign-up flow. The landing page incorporates essential personalization settings such as dark/light mode and language toggling, ensuring that every visitor can tailor the experience to their preferences. Error states and validation within the contact form guarantee that once engagement is initiated, communication remains effective and efficient. Ultimately, the flow is intended to convey clarity and ease of navigation, leading potential users smoothly from initial discovery to account creation and further interaction on the main platform.
