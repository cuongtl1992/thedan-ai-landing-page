Update this rule if user requested changes to the project requirement, etc.
## Project Overview

* **Type:** Landing Page
* **Description:** Create a simple, modern, and easy-to-deploy landing page for TheDan AI to introduce the AI Agent Builder Platform and attract users.
* **Primary Goal:** Introduce the platform effectively, highlight its core features, and drive user sign-ups via an external link (https://app.thedan.biz).

## Project Structure

### Framework-Specific Routing

* **Directory Rules:**

    * **Next.js 14 (App Router):** Use `app/[route]/page.tsx` conventions for all pages.
    * Example 1: For the Hero Section, the component should reside in `app/hero/page.tsx`.
    * Example 2: For the Contact Form, create `app/contact/page.tsx` following nested routes if needed.

### Core Directories

* **Versioned Structure:**

    * **app/**: Contains all routing logic using Next.js 14 App Router structure (e.g. `app/hero`, `app/overview`, `app/pricing`, `app/contact`).
    * Example 1: `app/api` → Reserved for any server actions if required in the future.

### Key Files

* **Stack-Versioned Patterns:**

    * **`app/layout.tsx`:** Root layout file enforcing consistent theming and global configuration (including dark/light mode toggling).
    * Example 1: `app/_app.tsx` is not used in Next.js 14 App Router, ensuring that App Router conventions are strictly followed.

## Tech Stack Rules

* **Version Enforcement:**

    * **next@14:** Must use the App Router exclusively; avoid any usage of `pages/` directory or legacy routing methods.
    * **typescript:** Enforce strict type checking and proper type declarations throughout the codebase.
    * **tailwindcss:** Utilize the given CSS color variables for theming with Tailwind configuration tailored for both dark and light modes.
    * **shadcn components:** Implement modern UI components as per provided guidelines, ensuring consistency across the landing page.

## PRD Compliance

* **Non-Negotiable:**

    * "Create a simple, modern, and easy-to-deploy landing page for TheDan AI to introduce the platform and attract users." → All design and implementation decisions must align with this goal, ensuring rapid load times, a single-page layout, and smooth navigation with no AI-generated images.

## App Flow Integration

* **Stack-Aligned Flow:**

    * The landing page is a single-page layout with navigation links that scroll smoothly to sections such as Hero, Overview, Pricing, and Contact.
    * The hero section includes a catchy tagline and a call-to-action button that redirects to https://app.thedan.biz.
    * The navigation bar supports dynamic toggles for dark/light mode with a smooth 200-300ms transition.
    * External authentication is handled by redirecting to the provided sign in/up link (https://app.thedan.biz).

## Best Practices

* **Next.js 14:**
    * Use the App Router consistently, with all route segments structured under the `app/` directory.
    * Avoid mixing legacy Pages Router logic to prevent routing conflicts.
    * Leverage Server Actions where applicable for data-fetching operations.

* **TypeScript:**
    * Maintain strict type safety and use explicit type annotations.
    * Ensure proper use of interfaces and type definitions across components.
    * Regularly update tsconfig settings to reflect best practices.

* **Tailwind CSS:**
    * Configure Tailwind to use the provided CSS color variables for consistent theming.
    * Utilize responsive design utilities to ensure compatibility across devices.
    * Optimize CSS builds to reduce load times.

* **Shadcn components:**
    * Use pre-built and well-tested UI components to accelerate development.
    * Customize components minimally with CSS overrides where necessary for branding consistency.
    * Follow recommended patterns for component composition and state management.

## Rules

* Derive folder/file patterns **directly** from tech stack versions provided.
* For Next.js 14 App Router: Enforce use of the `app/` directory with nested route folders for each section.
* Never mix routing patterns (e.g., using `pages/` in an App Router project is prohibited).
* Ensure external links (like the Sign In / Sign Up) are clearly marked and follow redirection protocols.

## Rules Metrics

Before starting the project development, create a metrics file in the root of the project called `cursor_metrics.md`.

### Instructions:

* Each time a cursor rule is used as context, update `cursor_metrics.md`.
* Use the following format for `cursor_metrics.md:`

# Rules Metrics

## Usage

The number of times rules is used as context

* rule-name.mdc: 0
* another-rule.mdc: 0
* ...other rules
