# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. **Prevalidation:** Check if the current directory is already a Next.js project (look for package.json and next.config.js). If found, skip project initialization. *(Project Requirements: General Setup)*

2. **Verify Node.js Environment:** Run `node -v` and `npm -v` to ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. *(Tech Stack: Core Tools)*

3. **Install Next.js 14 If Needed:** Confirm that Next.js 14 is used (exact requirement). If not, install or create a new project using Next.js 14. *(Tech Stack: Frontend - Next.js 14 is required for compatibility with current AI coding tools)*

4. **Cursor Environment Setup:**
   - Check if the `.cursor` directory exists in the project root. If not, create it. *(Cursor: Environment Setup)
   - Within the `.cursor` directory, create a file named `cursor_metrics.md` if it does not already exist. *(Cursor: Environment Setup)*
   - Refer to the file `cursor_project_rules.mdc` for guidance on populating `cursor_metrics.md`.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

5. **Initialize Next.js 14 Project:** Run the command:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@14 --typescript thedan-ai
   ```
   This ensures the project uses Next.js 14 with TypeScript. *(Project Requirements: Tech Stack)

6. **Navigate into Project Directory:** Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd thedan-ai
   ```
   *(General Setup)*

7. **Set Up Tailwind CSS:** Follow the Tailwind CSS setup for Next.js by installing dependencies and adding configuration files (tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js) along with the provided CSS variables for theming. *(Project Requirements: Design & Theme; Tech Stack: Tailwind CSS)

8. **Integrate Shadcn Components:** Install and configure Shadcn UI components to be used throughout the landing page. *(Project Requirements: Design & Theme; Tech Stack: Shadcn components)

9. **Develop Navigation Bar Component:** Create a component (`/src/components/Navbar.tsx`) with the following features:
   - Smooth scrolling links to Features, Pricing, About Us, and Contact sections.
   - Language toggle (default Vietnamese, secondary English).
   - Light/Dark mode toggle with a smooth fade transition (200-300ms).
   - "Sign In / Sign Up" link redirecting to [https://app.thedan.biz](mdc:https:/app.thedan.biz).
   *(Project Requirements: Navigation Bar)

10. **Create Hero Section Component:** Create `/src/components/Hero.tsx` that includes:
    - A catchy tagline.
    - A prominent call-to-action button linking to [https://app.thedan.biz](mdc:https:/app.thedan.biz).
    *(Project Requirements: Hero Section)

11. **Build Overview Section Component:** Create `/src/components/Overview.tsx` that explains core functionalities and benefits of TheDan AI. *(Project Requirements: Overview Section)*

12. **Develop Pricing Section Component:** Create `/src/components/Pricing.tsx` that displays the following plans:
    - Personal: 499.000đ (1 Agent + 1 MCP)
    - Pro: 799.000đ (5 Agents + 5 MCP)
    - Business: 1.499.000đ (20 Agents + 20 MCP)
    *(Project Requirements: Pricing Section)*

13. **Implement Contact/Lead Capture Form:** Create `/src/components/ContactForm.tsx` with input fields for Name, Email, and Message. Include:
    - Validation for each field.
    - A confirmation message on successful submission.
    - A privacy notice.
    *(Project Requirements: Contact/Lead Capture Form)

14. **Ensure Responsive Design:** Utilize Tailwind CSS utilities to guarantee that all components render well on a range of devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). *(Project Requirements: Responsive Design)

15. **Client-Side Form Validation:** Add basic TypeScript-based validation logic for the contact form. *(Project Requirements: Contact Form)

## Phase 3: SEO and Meta Data Setup

16. **Configure Meta Tags:** In the main `<Head>` component (e.g., `/src/app/head.tsx`), add meta tags for SEO, including title, description, and keywords. *(Project Requirements: SEO)

17. **Add Social Media Settings:** Within the `<Head>` component, include Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social media preview. *(Project Requirements: SEO)

18. **Integrate Structured Data:** Embed JSON-LD structured data for schema.org to improve search engine understanding. *(Project Requirements: SEO)

## Phase 4: Integration and Interactivity

19. **Implement Smooth Scrolling:** Enhance navigation links to smoothly scroll to their respective sections using an appropriate JavaScript library or CSS scroll-behavior property. *(Project Requirements: Navigation Bar)

20. **Enable Language Toggle Functionality:** Develop a state-based language toggle mechanism in the navbar that conditionally renders content in Vietnamese or English. *(Project Requirements: Navigation Bar)

21. **Implement Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Create theme toggle functionality using Tailwind CSS classes and CSS variables. Ensure the transition duration is set to 200-300ms for a smooth fade effect. *(Project Requirements: Navigation Bar and Design & Theme)

22. **Link External Sign In/Sign Up:** Verify that the "Sign In / Sign Up" link always redirects users to [https://app.thedan.biz](mdc:https:/app.thedan.biz). *(Project Requirements: Navigation Bar)

## Phase 5: Deployment

23. **Prepare for GitHub Pages Deployment:** Update `next.config.js` to include configuration for static export if necessary (via `next export`). *(Project Requirements: Deployment)

24. **Build and Export the Static Site:** Run the build command and then export the site:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run export
    ```
    *(Project Requirements: Deployment; Fast loading times)

25. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:** Follow these steps:
    - Create a GitHub repository.
    - Push your exported site content to the `gh-pages` branch.
    - Configure GitHub Pages via repository settings to serve from the `gh-pages` branch.
    *(Project Requirements: Deployment)

26. **Integrate Google Analytics:** Add the Google Analytics script tag (with your tracking ID) to the `<Head>` component to enable site analytics. *(Project Requirements: Analytics)

## Final Validation and Testing

27. **Component-Level Testing:** Run your application locally (`npm run dev`) and manually verify that:
    - All sections (Hero, Overview, Pricing, Contact) display as expected.
    - Navigation links perform smooth scrolling.
    - Language toggle correctly switches content.
    - Light/Dark mode transitions smoothly (200-300ms).
    *(Project Requirements: All UI Sections, Responsive Design)

28. **SEO Testing:** Use browser plugins or online tools to validate meta tags, social previews, and structured data.

29. **Form Validation Testing:** Submit the contact form with valid and invalid data to ensure that validation messages and confirmation messages work as expected.

30. **Deployment Check:** After deploying to GitHub Pages, visit your deployed site and check fast loading times, responsiveness, and correct integration of all functionalities.

31. **Final Review:** Confirm that all links, toggles, and sections operate as intended and that the overall design follows the provided CSS themes and guidelines.
